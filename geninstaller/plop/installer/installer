"""
This fast installer is destined to the developpers who want to create
their own quick installer, in the 'geninstaller' way.
Just read the comments and complete the informations asked below,
the magic will do the rest.

IMPORTANT:
Geninstaller only installs applications in the user's space, it does not
access to the system files. Therefore, each installation is relative
to one user of the computer. It is possible to install the application
on multiple sessions, but each application installed will remain totally
independent.
